# Spine Viewer Pro

Browser-based viewer for [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) skeletal animations. Supports Spine versions 3.8–4.2 with Pixi.js 7 and 8. Runs entirely in the browser — no installation, no server, no data upload.

### Export
| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PNG** | Current frame screenshot |
| **Pose JSON** | Snapshot of all bone transforms |
| **Sprite Sheet** | N-frame grid as a single PNG |
| **GIF** | Animated GIF with configurable FPS and quality |

### Compare Mode

Side-by-side visual and structural comparison of two Spine skeletons. Accessible from the picker page and the viewer toolbar.

**Layout**
- Two independent Pixi canvases rendered side by side with a resizable divider
- Per-canvas control bar: side badge (A / B), skin selector, animation selector, time, FPS
- Diff panel with three configurable positions: left, right, bottom (persisted)

**Synchronized Playback**
- **Time sync** (↺) — mirrors time position in real-time from Master to Secondary
- **Viewport sync** (⊞) — mirrors pan and zoom between canvases
- **Animation sync** — changing animation on one side auto-applies the same name to the other (if found)
- **Skin sync** — skin changes mirrored when sync is enabled

**Diff Panel**
- Runs automatically when both canvases finish loading — no manual trigger needed
- Sections: Skeleton meta · Bones · Slots · Skins · Animations · Events · Constraints · IK / Transform / Path constraints
- **Reskin Overview** (always shown first):
  - Animation presence + duration delta
  - Skin presence diff
  - Event definition presence diff
  - Per-animation event timing diff (JSON only)
  - Placeholder slots / bones / attachments with critical parameter change detection
- Severity badges: 🔴 critical (missing name, missing event, placeholder changed) · 🟠 non-critical (duration delta, timing delta)

**Placeholder Labels**
- `ph` checkbox in each canvas overlay — show/hide named placeholder overlays
- Shared setting with the main viewer; persisted

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `←` / `→` | Step −1 / +1 frame |
| `R` | Reset pose (clear all tracks) |
| `L` | Toggle loop on current track |
| `Shift+L` | Toggle loop on all tracks |
| `0`–`9` | Select track 0–9 |

## Supported Versions

| Pixi.js | Spine Runtime |
|---------|--------------|
| Pixi 7 | Spine 3.8, 4.0, 4.1 |
| Pixi 8 | Spine 4.2 |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended: Node 22 via `nvm use 22`)

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

---

## Usage

1. Open the app — you'll see the **Version Picker** page.
2. **Drop your Spine files** (`.json`/`.skel` + `.atlas` + images) onto the drop zone, or click **Choose Files** / **Choose Folder**.
3. The app auto-detects the Spine version and selects the matching runtime.
4. Click **Open Viewer**.
5. Use the **Anim** tab to select animations and control playback.
6. Explore the other tabs: **Insp**, **Atlas**, **Perf**, **Compl**, **Export**.

### Multi-Spine Workflow
When you drop multiple Spine skeletons, all are loaded into slots. The **Spines** tab appears in the viewer — click any entry to switch. Each skeleton's viewport, animation, and playback state is saved independently.

## Developer Notes

### Pixi DevTools
The app exposes the active Pixi application instance for the [Pixi DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pixi-inspector/aamddddknhcagpehecnhphigffljadon) browser extension:
```js
globalThis.__PIXI_APP__ = app
```

**Known limitation:** After a hard page reload (`Ctrl+R` / `F5`) with DevTools already open, the Pixi Inspector panel may show `uniqueContextId not found`. This is a bug in the extension — it caches the old execution context ID and doesn't re-register after navigation.

Workarounds (pick one):
- Open DevTools **after** the viewer is loaded and the animation is playing
- Navigate picker → viewer **without** reloading the page (SPA navigation keeps the same context)
- After a page reload: close and reopen the DevTools window to get a fresh context

### Version Injection
Build version is injected at compile time from `package.json` via `vite.config.ts`:
```ts
define: { __APP_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(pkg.version) }
```

### Dual Pixi Strategy
Both Pixi 7 and Pixi 8 are installed simultaneously. Vite aliases (`pixi7` / `pixi8`) and a custom `spinePixi8Redirect` plugin ensure each Spine runtime uses the correct Pixi instance without registry conflicts.
